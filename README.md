## Abstract
This research is devoted to the problem of search and selection of educational resources. The main objective is to create a recommendation system for optimizing an individual educational trajectory using machine learning methods.

### Tasks to achieve the goal of the research:
-   Choose the most appropriate method for text classification.
-   Prepare a dataset for analysis.
-   Build a mathematical model and train it on the prepared data set.
-   Develop an interface.

During the study of machine learning methods, it was found out that the most suitable method is an artificial neural network. To train it, a dataset was prepared, which consists of the texts of publications from the groups of the social network â€œVKontakte". The texts were divided into categories describing their educational subject. The TensorFlow library was chosen to build a mathematical model as a widely used platform in machine learning. After studying the documentation, a neural network was built and trained to classify text. A program (chatbot) that interacts with the API (application programming interface) VKontakte was developed to let users conveniently interact with the classifier. Thus, the model can be used through a dialog in the social network. The program analyzes the user's current subscriptions and suggests several groups that are suitable for their estimated interests.

### In conclusion, it should be noted that the objectives set at the beginning of the research were accomplished, particularly:
-   A suitable method was chosen - a neural network.
-   A dataset which consists of the texts of publications has been prepared.
-   A neural network that classifies text into specific categories has been built.
-   An interface in the form of a VKontakte chatbot has been developed.
